## User Stories

```
As a user, I can quickly create a secure account using basic information, such as email and password. 

As a user, I can see a dashboard of all people I plan to purchase gifts from, to determine if any 
additional people need to be added to the list. 

As a user, I am provided a link from the dashboard to quickly and easily add new people I
intend to purchase gifts. From the dashboard, I have the ability to view the recipient page or
remove recipient, as necessary.

As a user, I am provided a unique page by recipient, that displays budgeted amount and actual
amount spent on gifts.

As a user, I am provided a listing of gifts that I intend or have purchased, as well as the ability
to edit the status of the gift or delete the gift, as necessary.

As a user, I am provided graphaical statistics of my overall budgeted vs. actual amount spent.

As a user, I am provided a home and about page that explains the background of the app and 
how to use the app.
