## User Story
As a realtor, I want a secure web app that provides me the ability to create, update and delete listings in real time. 

As a realtor, I want a web app that allows me to create blog articles that are relevant to my prospective clients in the homebuying process. 

As a realtor, I want to provide an application that provides the prospective home buyer the ability to view a comprehensive listing of houses for sale, along with associated realtors and cities served. Prospective home buyers will be able to find the site and come to a landing page showing a featured home or proceed to additional listing of houses, which the user will be able to click on a house listing to obtain more data, as well as the listing agent.

Additionally, as a realtor, I want to provide the prospective home buyer the ability to search the regions served by Vanford Realty and associated homes in those regions as well as realtors serving those regions.
